Description: Utilizing R to import and clean data is often a time consuming task.  
        Without preparation of the dataset in excel or other software, R users must use scripts or 
        command line R code for this task.  The Interactive Data Cleaning tool will afford users 
        the ability to do the following: Import Data, Visually inspect the previously imported data, 
        Select releveant data columns to retain/remove, Provide the ability to rename columns in the 
        dataframe, Select relevant data rows to retain/remove, Provide the option to scale the data, 
        Provide the option to mean center the data, Provide the ability to impute missing numerical 
        data, Provide the ability to encode nominal data to numerical data, Save the new data to a 
        "cleaned" dataframe, Write the "clean" DF to excel document for future use.
